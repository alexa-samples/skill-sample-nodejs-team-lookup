## Testing Your Alexa Skill

So far, we have [created a Voice User Interface](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-team-lookup/blob/master/instructions/1-voice-user-interface.md) and [a Lambda function](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-team-lookup/blob/master/instructions/2-lambda-function.md), and [connected the two together](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-team-lookup/blob/master/instructions/3-connect-vui-to-lambda.md).  Your skill is now ready to test.

1.  **Go back to the [Amazon Developer Portal](https://developer.amazon.com/edw/home.html#/skills/list) and select your skill from the list.** You may still have a browser tab open if you started at the beginning of this tutorial.

2.  **Open the "Test" tab on the left side.**

    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/general/4-2-test-tab._TTH_.png" />

3.  **Understand the voice simulator.** While it's not specific to your skill, the Voice Simulator is a valuable testing tool for every skill. Type a word into the box, and click the "Listen" button to hear how Alexa will
pronounce it. To make changes to her pronunciation, use Speech Synthesis Markup Language [(SSML)](https://developer.amazon.com/public/solutions/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/docs/speech-synthesis-markup-language-ssml-reference) to modify how Alexa will interpret text to speech. Try these examples:

    ```html
    <say-as interpret-as="number">12345</say-as>
    ```

    ```html
    <say-as interpret-as="ordinal">12345</say-as>
    ```

    ```html
    <say-as interpret-as="digits">12345</say-as>
    ```

    <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/general/4-3-voice-simulator._TTH_.png" />

    Return to the Voice Simulator as needed to ensure that Alexa says words and phrases as you would expect.

4.  **Test your skill with the Service Simulator.** To validate that your skill is working as expected, use the Service Simulator.  In the **Enter Utterance** text box, type "tell me about North Dakota."

    ### Service Simulator Tips
    * After you click the "Ask [Your Skill Name]" button, you should see the **Lambda Request** and **Lambda Response** boxes get populated with JSON data like in the screenshot above.
    * Click the **Listen** button in the bottom right corner to hear Alexa read the response.
    * You can have an entire conversation with your skill with the Service Simulator.  Try the following commands:
        * "Open team lookup"
        * [Press the listen button, and type your response in the box]

    ### Things to Try
       1. "open team lookup"
       2. "ask team lookup who is paul"
       3. "ask team lookup who is memo doring"
       4. "ask team lookup to find me an evangelist in seattle"
       5. "ask team lookup for dave's twitter handle"

        (Continue this process to search for team members. To start over, click the "Reset" button.)

    * If you receive a response that reads: *"The remote endpoint could not be called, or the response it returned was invalid,"* this is an indication that something is broken.  AWS Lambda offers an additional testing tool to help you troubleshoot your skill.

5.  **Configure a test event in AWS Lambda.** Now that you are familiar with the **request** and **response** boxes in the Service Simulator, it's important for you to know that you can use your **requests** to directly test your Lambda function every time you update it.  To do this:
    1.  Create & copy a new response with the Service Simulator, or grab the sample text from the box below:

    ```JAVASCRIPT
    {
      "session": {
        "sessionId": "SessionId.12345678-b188-4c85-a368-29f3c6a8310f",
        "application": {
          "applicationId": "amzn1.ask.skill.12345678-c14b-4747-843f-050232c2ffc9"
        },
        "attributes": {},
        "user": {
          "userId": "amzn1.ask.account.AHHXWUXY***"
        },
        "new": true
      },
      "request": {
        "type": "IntentRequest",
        "requestId": "EdwRequestId.12345678-3165-46c7-8438-0ed70176baea",
        "locale": "en-US",
        "timestamp": "2017-04-24T09:33:35Z",
        "intent": {
          "name": "SearchByNameIntent",
          "slots": {
            "lastName": {
              "name": "lastName"
            },
            "firstName": {
              "name": "firstName",
              "value": "Amit"
            },
            "infoType": {
              "name": "infoType"
            },
            "whatPhrase": {
              "name": "whatPhrase"
            },
            "whoPhrase": {
              "name": "whoPhrase",
              "value": "who is"
            }
          }
        }
      },
      "version": "1.0"
    }
    ```
    2.  **Open your Lambda function in AWS, open the Actions menu, and select "Configure test event."**

        <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/general/4-5-2-configure-test-event._TTH_.png" />

    3.  **Choose "Alexa Start Session" from the Sample Event Template dropdown list.** You can choose any item in the list, as they are just templated event requests, but using "Alexa Start Session" is an easy one to remember.  This will also be the sample request that fires every time you update and "Save and Test" your Lambda code.

        <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/general/4-5-3-alexa-start-session._TTH_.png" />

    4.  **Delete the contents of the box, and paste your request into the box.**

        <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/team-lookup/4-5-4-paste-request._TTH_.png" />

    5.  **Click the "Save and test" button.** This will save your test event, and run it against your Lambda function.

        <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/general/4-5-5-save-and-test._TTH_.png" />

        This gives you visibility into four things:

        *  **Your response, listed in the "Execution Result."**

           <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/team-lookup/4-5-5-1-execution-result._TTH_.png" />

        *  **A Summary of the statistics for your request.** This includes things like duration, resources, and memory used.

           <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/team-lookup/4-5-5-2-summary._TTH_.png" />

        *  **Log output.**  By effectively using console.log() statements in your Lambda code, you can track what is happening inside your function, and help to figure out what is happening when something goes wrong.  You will find the log to be incredibly valuable as you move into more advanced skills.

           <img src="https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/mobile-apps/dex/alexa/alexa-skills-kit/tutorials/team-lookup/4-5-5-3-log-output._TTH_.png"/>

        *  **A link to your [CloudWatch](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logs:) logs for this function.**  This will show you **all** of the responses and log statements from every user interaction.  This is very useful, especially when you are testing your skill from a device with your voice.  (It is the "[Click here](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=us-east-1#logs:)" link in the Log Output description.)

6.  **Other testing methods to consider:**

    *  [Echosim.io](https://echosim.io) - a browser-based Alexa skill testing tool that makes it easy to test your skills without carrying a physical device everywhere you go.
    *  [Unit Testing with Alexa](https://github.com/alexa/skill-sample-nodejs-team-lookup/blob/master/unit-testing.md) - a modern approach to unit testing your Alexa skills with [Postman](http://getpostman.com) and [Amazon API Gateway](http://aws.amazon.com/apigateway).

7.  **Verify that cards are working properly.**  Open the Alexa app on your phone, or at http://alexa.amazon.com.

    *  Ask the skill for a team member's twitter handle: "Alexa, ask Team Lookup for Amit's twitter handle."
    *  Verify that a card was created in the Alexa app that resembles this screenshot:

8.  **If your sample skill is working properly, you can now customize your skill.**
